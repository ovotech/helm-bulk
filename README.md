# Helm-Bulk

[![CircleCI](https://circleci.com/gh/ovotech/helm-bulk/tree/master.svg?style=svg&circle-token=0171f4a6c05ad17bc42cd34d04bef0b9df026dbb)](https://circleci.com/gh/ovotech/helm-bulk/tree/master)

This is a Helm plugin that loads or saves Helm releases from File to Cluster,
or Cluster to File, respectively.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```
$ git clone git@github.com:ovotech/helm-bulk.git
```

Build the binary:

```
$ cd helm-bulk

$ go build
```

Ensure the `command` path in `plugin.yaml` is the absolute path to the binary you've just built (note: don't use `~` in the path). The binary name (should be "helm-bulk") needs to be present at the end.

The plugin hasn't been open sourced yet, so the absolute path to the local checked out git repo (rather than the git https url) must be given to Helm in order to install it.

```
$ helm plugin install <abs_path_to_local_git_dir>
```

This will:

1. Find the `plugin.yaml` in the directory you give it
2. Execute the file specified in `hooks: install:` (useful for any pre-install
  operations)
3. Copy the file that's specified in the `command` value into the Helm plugin directory (defaults to `.helm/plugins/`). This is the file that'll be executed when you invoke the plugin with Helm, i.e. `helm bulk`.

The final String of the output, on a successful install, will be: `Installed plugin: bulk`.


You can also verify it's been installed using:

```
$ helm plugin list                                     

NAME	VERSION	DESCRIPTION
bulk	0.0.8  	Load or Save Helm Releases from File to Cluster, or Cluster to File, respectively
```

Try invoking it:

```
$ helm bulk

Load or Save Releases from File to Cluster, or Cluster to File, respectively
...
...
```

## Getting Started

`helm-bulk` will only ever use your current kubectl context, so make sure
you've switched to whatever Context/Cluster you want to use (e.g. `kubectl
  config use-context <context_name` or `gcloud container clusters....` to
  re-auth into your target Cluster).

If end-to-end testing, try following these commands through in order, otherwise
they can be run individually:

```
# Use Helm to list your Releases
$ helm ls

# Save deployed Helm Releases to archive (defaults to "./helm-releases.tar.gz")
$ helm bulk save

# Print out a list of Helm Releases currently stored in the archive
# (defaults to "./helm-releases.tar.gz")
$ helm bulk show

###############################################################################
# if e-2-e testing, simulate loss of Helm Releases in Cluster here
#Â e.g.:
# recreate cluster, delete all current Helm Releases in Cluster, OR switch
# kubectl context to a fresh Cluster
###############################################################################

# Load Helm Releases from File into your Cluster
$ helm bulk load

# Use Helm to list the Releases again
$ helm ls
```

## Idempotency

`helm bulk load` will attempt to get the Helm Releases in your Cluster to reflect what you have in your File, but only for those Releases defined. It won't touch any Releases you may already have in your Cluster.

If you already have one or more of the Releases in your File installed in your
Cluster, then things get a little more complicated than working with an 'empty'
Cluster. `helm-bulk` needs to work out whether to delete the existing Releases,
or upgrade them.

By default, `helm-bulk` will delete the existing Releases. If you want it to upgrade them instead, then use the `-n,--non-authoritative` flag.

`helm-bulk` is designed to be used shortly after Cluster create (obviously post tiller install), in which case there won't be any existing Helm Releases.

## Release Naming

When you install a Helm Chart, if you don't provide a name, Helm will generate one for you, e.g. "kissing-wildebeest". Subsequent `helm upgrade` commands
will create new Releases with different names. **All** of these Releases will then be returned when running `helm ls`, and therefore will also make it into your File after a `helm bulk save`.

This would lead to greater processing times when running a `helm bulk load` or
`helm bulk save`, and a larger persisted File.

To prevent this, it's recommended to always name your Release when installing,
so you only have one current Release (and any upgrades to that will supersede,
with version number incrementing).

## Release History

History of Helm Releases is currently not persisted.
